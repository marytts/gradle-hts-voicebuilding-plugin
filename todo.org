#+begin_src groovy
task prepareData() {
    (new File(DataFileFinder.getFilePath(config.data.list_files))).eachLine { basename ->
        dependsOn ":${basename}:generateCMP"
    }

    /* We have also to adapt a little bit the coefficient paths */
    project.configuration.user_configuration.models.cmp.streams.each { stream ->
        stream.coeffDir = "$project.buildDir/${stream.coeffDir}"
    }
}
#+end_src
